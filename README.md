This project was created by Mohammed Yessine Kraiem
The program is fully compiled in the "Final_Program" application. We have also provided scripts for each game as well as the main code so that you can examine our progress in more detail.

The project consists of a game manager that allows you to choose games to play and record your progress. You can also add new games and learn more about the existing ones.

Interface Explanation:
When the application is launched, you will be greeted by 5 options numbered from 1 to 5:

To discover the games we have created, press 1.
You will access a full list of available games.

To choose a game and play, press 2.
You will then need to select a game from the list of games you reviewed in the first option:

If you press 1, you will play Game 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
If you press 2, you will play Game 2: Hangman.
And so on for the other games.
To view your progress in the application, press 3.
You will see:

The game you have played the most.
Your scores.
Your best and worst game.
To add a game to the list, press 4.
Then, enter the name and description of your game. We will add it later.

To exit the application, press 5.

With this user-friendly interface, have fun! ðŸŽ®

Note: You must launch the games from "Final_Program" and not individually. Thank you!**********
